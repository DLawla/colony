####DONE
- [DONE] Two planets (drawn), rendered w/ mouse selection and image change when selected

- [DONE] Create populations (increase by planet size, so hold a population and max population value) and ensure they max out out
- [DONE] When selected, support moving ALL planet's population to an adjacent selected planet
- [DONE] When a planet is selected, on mousing over a nearby planet
- [DONE] Planet transfer animation
- [DONE] Extracting all planet selection logic into Selection.rb
- [DONE] Clean up planet.rb, if required
- [DONE] Random planet location generator
- [DONE] Figure out a way to capture what an adjacent planet is -- DONE via row instance variable


####TODO
- [] Create new objects for transferring populations (ships), which tranfer from planet to planet
   and take time to move (would look cool as trailing lines)
- [] When a planet is selected, draw a line (thick, so maybe many) to all planets that can transfer to
- [] When hovering over transfer line, or its planet, make it be a new color
- [] When transferring to another planet, allow clicking on transfer line, where the location of the click on the
    transfer line denotes how much to transfer
- [] Create an indicator of some sort for population relative to max (maybe a circumference line)
- [] Import music
   Have two .ogg files, but this is awesome too: Miracle by Blackmill﻿ OR Know You Well (Feat. Laura Hahn) by Michael St﻿ Laurent
- [] Import music toggle
- [] Start menu w/ start game button
- [] Support for ending a game, showing total time, and allowing a restart
