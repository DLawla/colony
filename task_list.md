####DONE
- [DONE] Two planets (drawn), rendered w/ mouse selection and image change when selected
- [DONE] Import planet sprites
- [DONE] Create random planet sizing, give planet a size trait, and adjust selection box accordingly
- [DONE] Create populations (increase by planet size, so hold a population and max population value) and ensure they max out out
- [DONE] When selected, support moving ALL planet's population to an adjacent selected planet
- [DONE] When a planet is selected, on mousing over a nearby planet
- [DONE] Planet transfer animation
- [DONE] Extracting all planet selection logic into Selection.rb
- [DONE] Clean up planet.rb, if required
- [DONE] Random planet location generator
- [DONE] Figure out a way to capture what an adjacent planet is -- DONE via row instance variable


####TODO
- [] When a planet is selected and hovering over a planet that can transfer to, draw a line to the mouse of a maximum length, showing
   a value of the current line length (0 - 100%)
- [] Get some trigger to fire when the mouse is released, and returns the length of the line
- [] Create a way for the population transfer line to 'stick' with an adjacent planet (ie, if pointing towards it or
   +/- 10 degrees) it will stick on it.
- [] Population transfer line changes color depending on if it is lined up with another planet or not
- [] Create new objects for transferring populations (ships), which tranfer from planet to planet
   and take time to move (would look cool as trailing lines)
- [] Create an indicator of some sort for population relative to max (maybe a circumference line)
- [] Import music
   Have two .ogg files, but this is awesome too: Miracle by Blackmill﻿ OR Know You Well (Feat. Laura Hahn) by Michael St﻿ Laurent
- [] Import music toggle
